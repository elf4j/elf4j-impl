## Any level is optional, default to TRACE if omitted
## This override the default global level
level=info
## These override level of all caller classes included the specified package
#level@elf4j.impl=error
level@org.springframework=warn
## Any writer is optional, default to a single console writer if no writer configured
writer1=console
## This is the default output pattern
writer1.pattern={timestamp} {level} [{thread}] {class} - {message}
## This would customize the format patterns of the specified writer
#writer1.pattern={timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZZZZ} {level:5} [{thread:name|id}] {class:simple|full|compressed}: {message}
## Multiple writers are supported, each with its own configurations
writer2=console
#writer2.level=trace
## Default json pattern does not include thread and caller details, and uses pretty print format for the JSON string
writer2.pattern={json}
## This would force the JSON to include the thread/caller details
#writer2.pattern={json:thread-detail,caller-detail}
## This would minify the JSON string from the pretty print format
#writer2.pattern={json:thread-detail,caller-detail,minify}
## This would force the writer to use stderr instead of stdout
#writer2.stream=stderr
